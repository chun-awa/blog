# The Zen of Gaming, by [mel@dy](https://steamcommunity.com/id/melodyecho/) (<https://github.com/aicorein>)
Friendship is better than isolation.
Connection is better than detachment.
Respect is better than intolerance.
Community is better than division.
Integrity is better than deception.
Support for the original is better than piracy.
Cheating is not the path to glory.
Silence the trolls, let the games speak.
In the face of negativity, choose kindness.
There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to play fair.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're a gamer at heart.
Now is better than never, but patience is a virtue.
If the game is hard to understand, it’s probably a masterpiece waiting to be appreciated.
If the game is easy to understand, it’s probably fun and exciting, just like it should be.
Unity in action -- let’s build a group that thrives on real mutual respect and shared passion.
Whatever pulls us into the world of gaming – the art of play binds us all.
Let's embrace the journey together, across all regions and nations.
